            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is <strong>Jonathan Gauvin-Audet</strong>. I'm 30 years old and I'm a full-time R&D researcher scientist with a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry and a Master's degree in Materials Chemistry, specializing in heterogeneous catalysis and silica nanotechnology. 
                I have significant experience in both academic and industrial research environments, having managed numerous R&D projects that focus on green chemistry, nanomaterials, and process optimization.
                <br><br>
                In my role as a R&D Specialist, I lead innovative projects including the development of high-performance silica from recycled glass, the encapsulation of chemotherapeutic agents in nanovectors for drug delivery, and the creation of anti-corrosion coatings for various industries. Additionally, I have experience in scaling up reactions for CO<sub>2</sub> conversion and analyzing its kinetics using advanced techniques like FTIR and microfluidic devices.
                <br><br>
                As I progress in my career, Iâ€™ve developed a passion for integrating IT into my scientific work. I am currently pursuing a Certificate in Information Technology from McGill University, aiming to enhance my research with computational tools, data analysis, and software development. I'm proficient in programming languages like Java and SQL, which I plan to leverage for future innovation in R&D.
                <br><br>
                Beyond my professional endeavors, I am a certified snowboard instructor, a dedicated traveler, and an avid wine enthusiast. These activities fuel my passion for continuous learning and personal growth.
