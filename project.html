                <h3>Project 1: Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
                <p>
                    This project, as you can see here, is my first personal portfolio website showcasing a description of my work with pictures, my completed projects, future projects that I would like to undertake, a blog where I share things that I think are interesting, and my contact details.

                <h3>Project 2: Wine App</h3>
                <p> 
                    As a wine enthusiast, I have always wanted to create my own wine app since all the apps I found available on the Apple Store or Android Store were either not to my taste, costly, or didn't have the cellar option for keeping track of my wine, among other features. With this app, I could include all the options I want, such as tracking preferences and guiding users to wines that would fit their tastes. It would also have the option to scan wine labels to upload preferences, history, and other user reviews of the wine, as well as information about the winery and the regions where the grapes are cultivated, etc.  <a href="https://github.com/Chemboi/wine-app" target="_blank">View Project</a>
