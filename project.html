                <h3>Project 1: Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
                <p>
                    This project, as you can see here, is my first personal portfolio website showcasing a description of my work with pictures, my completed projects, future projects that I would like to undertake, a blog where I share things that I think are interesting, and my contact details. I shall share with you my advances and things that I updated on this project here. This project is still in a beta or first stage if I may, but there's already this that I would like to work on and improve.

                            As a wine enthusiast, I’ve always wanted to create my own wine app because most of the apps I found available on the Apple Store or Android Store were either not to my taste, costly, or lacked a cellar option to keep track of my wine, among other features. With this app, I could include all the options I want, such as tracking preferences and guiding users to wines that fit their tastes. It would also have the option to scan wine labels to upload preferences, history, and other user reviews, as well as information about the winery and the regions where the grapes are cultivated.
                            <br><br>
                            The project is still in the initial stages, as only the homepage is complete since I’m still learning the world of web development. Once I finish it, I plan to test it on my own before making it public or sharing it with friends. <a href="https://github.com/Chemboi/wine-app" target="_blank">View Project on Github</a>
