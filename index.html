                    <p>
                        Hi everyone! 
                        <br><br>
                        My name is <strong>Jonathan Gauvin-Audet</strong>. I'm 30 years old and I'm a full-time R&D reseacher scientist with a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry and a Master's degree in Materials Chemistry, specializing in heterogeneous catalysis and silica nanotechnology. 
                        I have significant experience in both academic and industrial research environments, having managed numerous R&D projects that focus on green chemistry, nanomaterials, and process optimization.
                        <br><br>
                        In my role as a R&D Specialist, I lead innovative projects including the development of high-performance silica from recycled glass, the encapsulation of chemotherapeutic agents in nanovectors for drug delivery, and the creation of anti-corrosion coatings for various industries. Additionally, I have experience in scaling up reactions for CO<sub>2</sub> conversion and analyzing its kinetics using advanced techniques like FTIR and microfluidic devices.
                        <br><br>
                        As I progress in my career, I’ve developed a passion for integrating IT into my scientific work. I am currently pursuing a Certificate in Information Technology from McGill University, aiming to enhance my research with computational tools, data analysis, and software development. I'm proficient in programming languages like Java and SQL, which I plan to leverage for future innovation in R&D.
                        <br><br>
                        Beyond my professional endeavors, I am a certified snowboard instructor, a dedicated traveler, and an avid wine enthusiast. These activities fuel my passion for continuous learning and personal growth.

                <p>
                    This project, as you can see here, is my first personal portfolio website showcasing a description of my work with pictures, my completed projects, future projects that I would like to undertake, a blog where I share things that I think are interesting, and my contact details.

                <h3>Project 2: Wine App</h3>
                <p> 
                    As a wine enthusiast, I have always wanted to create my own wine app since all the apps I found available on the Apple Store or Android Store were either not to my taste, costly, or didn't have the cellar option for keeping track of my wine, among other features. With this app, I could include all the options I want, such as tracking preferences and guiding users to wines that would fit their tastes. It would also have the option to scan wine labels to upload preferences, history, and other user reviews of the wine, as well as information about the winery and the regions where the grapes are cultivated, etc.  <a href="https://github.com/Chemboi/wine-app" target="_blank">View Project</a>

                <p>           
                    Back in 2021, two Princeton University researchers have developed an innovative approach to optimize chemical reactions using artificial intelligence, as published in the prestigious journal Nature. <a>(link below)</a> This groundbreaking study, led by Professor Abigail Doyle and computer scientist Ryan Adams, combines principles from chemistry and computer science to create a powerful tool for chemical synthesis. this tool is the Bayesian optimization, an iterative response surface-based global optimization algorithm. It has demonstrated exceptional performance in the tuning of machine learning model.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03213-y" target="_blank">Read Full Article</a>

                <h3>Blog Post 2: <i>Wine Chemistry and Flavor: Looking into the Crystal Glass</i></h3>
                <p>
                    The chemistry of wine is a complex field involving the analysis of flavor compounds that influence the taste and aroma of the final product. Recent advances in analytical techniques, such as gas chromatography, have enabled scientists to identify key volatile compounds contributing to wine's sensory attributes. These include alcohols, esters, and terpenes, which are critical for producing the fruity and floral notes in wines like Riesling and Muscat. Understanding the role of these compounds allows winemakers to control viticultural and fermentation practices, optimizing the flavor profile of wines.<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf9000555" target="_blank">Read Full Article</a>
